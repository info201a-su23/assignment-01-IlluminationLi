1. Create a Markdown file that will contain your report called report.md in the root directory of the repository.

**Answer**: Already created.

2. Come up with a title for your report, and make the title a top-level Markdown header.

**Answer**: Completed, see title above.

3. Include "By [Your Name]" on the line beneath the title, and make your name a level-2 header.

**Answer**: Completed, see my name above.

4. Include the date of your report on the next line, and make the date italicized

**Answer**: Completed, see the date above. This question doesn't mention specifically which header we should use, thus I assume we can use whichever header level we want.(Here I used the same level-2 header as my name)

5. Create a level-2 header titled "Data Viz Summary."

**Answer**: see next line:
## Data Viz Summary

6. Include an image of the data visualization by downloading the image and including it as a file in this repository (you will probably want to rename the file). Your image should display properly on GitHub, so if it's not showing up, you haven't used the correct file path.

**Answer**: Completed, see the file named "Image_DataVisualization" in the repository.

7. Beneath the image, provide a 100-word summary of the visualization — what specifically does the data viz show or communicate?

**Answer**: This map image shows where commuters run over black children on the pointes downtown Track (1971) highlighting the locations where black children had unfortunate car accidents on these streets. We can see that how white people treated the black community back in 1971. There was clear discrimination in the past years in these areas and most of the black people's rights were not be protected by the law (including their children)! It urges all people living at that time to treat people from different races equally and kindly. The map is a good data visualization in this case. We can clearly see the important role of data visualization in supportive evidence and statistics. Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. The image above is a useful tool that provides an easy way for readers to see and understand trends (outliers or  patterns) in data.
(Reference: The image is from a report called "Field Notes No. 3: The Geography of Children” which documented the racial inequities of Detroit children. The map was created by Gwendolyn Warren, the administrative director of the Detroit Geographic Expedition and Institute (DGEI), in a collaboration between Black young adults in Detroit and white academic geographers that lasted from 1968– 1971.)

8. Include a quotation from Data Feminism (or another source) about the data visualization or its significance somewhere in the summary. Format this quotation as a block quote.

**Answer**:
Block quote:
> Challenging power requires mobilizing data science to push back against existing and unequal power structures and to work toward more just and equitable futures.  As we will discuss in this chapter, the goal of challenging power is closely linked to the act of examining power, the first principle of data feminism

Just as what the map try to show, we need data visualization and data science because it's an importance tool to challenge and resist existing power structures that are characterized by inequality. We all want a more just and equitable future.

9. Create a level-2 header titled "Data Viz Biography."

**Answer**: see next line:
## Data Viz Biography

10. In this section, you will answer the following questions. Bold these questions, make them an ordered list, and then write answers (not bolded) beneath the questions:

**1).Who or what institution produced the visualization?**

**Answer**: (All answers below are not bolded)
Reference: The image is from a report called "Field Notes No. 3: The Geography of Children” which documented the racial inequities of Detroit children. The map was created by Gwendolyn Warren, the administrative director of the Detroit Geographic Expedition and Institute (DGEI), in a collaboration between Black young adults in Detroit and white academic geographers that lasted from 1968– 1971.

**2).When was it produced?**

**Answer**:

1971

**3).Who is the audience for the visualization?**

**Answer**:

The visualization is designed for various audiences, such as local residents, government officials, fairness advocates, and researchers, each with their own interests in understanding the challenges faced by black children in the area.

**4).How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**

**Answer**:

In my answer above (Q7), I already talked about how it will be interpreted by audience. I want to mention the misinterpretation that audience may have. Since data visualization can't provide 100% data to its audience. Some of the information will be lost (those must be explained by words, such as feelings, things that can't be seen). It also means that data visualization may be oversimplification that viewers might oversimplify the complex issues presented in the visualization. As a result, it may lead to an incomplete understanding of the whole story. Since audience don't know the whole story behind the graphs, it may result in ineffective solutions being proposed. For example, police maker may think the reason black children been killed is because there is no enough traffic lights in these blocks without additional words.

**5).How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**
**Answer**:
The map visualization highlights power imbalances and systemic issues in car accidents involving black children. It reflects racial disparities, economic inequality, and inadequate safety measures in that society at that time. It's a good resources that represents the unequal problem in that system and the unequal power dynamics between white drivers and black children, highlighting the marginalization of black individuals in both the local community and society at large. The local government must act to address these problems and ensure the safety of black individuals.

11. Lastly, add at least one hyperlink and one emoji somewhere in the report. You can add them anywhere! [2 points]
